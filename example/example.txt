Text & indenting
----------------

There are several reasons to write such a file:
  1. It doesn't exist.
  2. It may be useful to people who have to indent
a whole lot of text.
  3. If not you, who?

Input & Output

Input must take the form of a simple text file such
as this one.  Output takes the form of another simple
text file, but with select newlines removed to
prevent the "jagged right margin effect" when placed
in a window that wraps text automatically.

Languages
The program can be written in any language but must
accept input and produce output as described above.
It is OK to take input from standard input and send
output to standard output.  In fact that is how it
must be done.

Rules
How can it be determined whether or not to retain a
newline?  Here are some rules:

+ A newline adjacent to another newline is retained.

What about "subsection headings", such as 'Rules'
above?  How about:

+ Any newline following a line less than cutoff
length will be retained.
