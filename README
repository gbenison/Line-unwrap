This algorithm attempts to selectively remove newlines (i.e. merge lines)
in plain text input such that paragraph structure and special formatting
are retained - only spurious intra-paragraph newline characters are removed.

The motivation for this algorithm is described here:
http://gcbenison.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/a-program-to-intelligently-remove-carriage-returns-so-you-can-paste-text-without-having-it-look-awful/

Implementations are provided in several languages (one implementation in each
subdirectory of 'implementations')

Algorithm
---------
Merge line "n" with line "n+1" only if:

(line 'n' is not blank)
AND (line 'n+1' is not blank)
AND ((line n+1 begins with [A-Za-z])
     AND (appending the first word of line 'n+1' to line 'n'
          results in a line longer than line 'n+1'))
